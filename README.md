# Tools for track matching between WAGASCI/BabyMIND & NINJA at J-PARC (v0.0.1)

This is a set of tools for (muon) track matching between WAGASCI/BabyMIND detectors
and NINJA detectors (scintillation tracker only?).

## External dependencies (same as WAGASCI+BabyMIND Geant4 simulation)

Below is a copy of README.md in the MC simulation software written by Giorgio Pintaudi.

### GEANT4

[GEANT4](http://heant4.cern/ch/) is a toolkit for the simulation of
the passage of particles through matter developed by CERN.
Geant4 v10.5.0+ is recommended.

### ROOT

[ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) is an object-oriented program and
library developed by CERN. ROOT 6.20+ is recommended.

### BOOST

[BOOST](https://www.boost.org/) is a set of libraries for the C++
programming language that provides support for tasks and structures
such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation,
multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit
testing. Boost 1.53+ is recommended.

### Wagasci BabyMIND Monte Carlo
[Wagasci BabyMIND Monte Carlo](https://git.t2k.org/wagasci_babymind/wagasci-babymind-monte-carlo) is a developed Monte Carlo simulation software for the WAGASCI-BabyMIND experiment.
It includes necessary libraries for the analyses.
Wagasci BabyMIND Monte Carlo v0.1.12+ is recommended.

### Wagasci BabyMIND event display
[Wagasci BabyMIND event display](https://git.t2k.org/wagasci_babymind/wagasci-babymind-event-display) is an event display tool for the WAGASCI-BabyMIND experiment.
Wagasci BabyMIND event display v0.1.0+ is recommended.

### Wagasce Reconstruction

## Installation

Only the following operative systems are tested and supported:
 - CentOS 7 (KEKCC)
 - MacOS 10.15

To install the software with all its dependencies, use a bash shell script `install.bash` in Wagasci BabyMIND Monte Carlo.
For further info about the software installation, refer to the [WAGASCI BabyMIND Monte Carlo gitlab](https://git.t2k.org/wagasci_babymind/wagasci-babymind-monte-carlo).

To compile this NINJA reconstruction software,
```shell script
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DB2MC_PATH=<path/to/your/wagasci/mc/installation> \
  -DEVENT_DISPLAY_PATH=<path/to/your/wagasci/event/display/installation> \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/your/ninja/recon/installation>
make
make install
```
also it is useful to export environment variables in .bashrc:
```shell script
export CC=$(command -v gcc) // KEKCC only
export CXX=$(command -v g++) // KEKCC only
export BOOST_ROOT=<path/to/your/boost/installation> // KEKCC only
export B2MCDIR=<path/to/your/wagasci/mc/installation>
export EVENT_DISPLAYDIR=<path/to/your/wagasci/event/display/installation>
```
then you can avoid `B2MC_PATH` and `EVENT_DISPAY_PATH` when you cmake.

### KEKCC

For further info about how to create an account and use the KEKCC
cloud computing servers, refer to the [NINJA
wiki](https://www-he.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/research/Neutrino/ninja/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=software:howto:kekcc).

To recompile the package on KEKCC, move to the `build` folder and type:
```shell script
CC=$(command -v gcc) CXX=$(command -v g++) \
  BOOST_ROOT=<path/to/your/boost/installation> \
  cmake3 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/your/ninja/recon/installation> \
  -DB2MC_PATH=<path/to/your/wagasci/mc/installation> \
  -EVENT_DISPLAY_PATH=<path/to/your/wagasci/event/display/installation> ..
```

## Usage

First just type:
```shell script
<path/to/your/program/installation>
```
then you can find discriptions of each variable.

### File Separator

This program is used for separation of the NINJA tracker raw data into a day unit file.
Since WAGASCI-BabyMIND files are provided in a day unit, the tracker file also should be
separated into the unit.

### Hit Converter

This program is used for NINJA tracker raw data conversion to WAGASCI-BabyMIND general data format.
It converts NINJA tracker EASIROC raw data into WAGASCI-BabyMIND data format, B2HitSummary, and
push back each hits into the file.

#### Note: This is only used in real data because simulated data is generated in B2 data format.

### Track Match

This program is used for track matching between NINJA tracker and WAGASCI-BabyMIND detectors.
The merged file created in Hit Converter processes are analyzed and B2TrackSummary with NINJA
tracker hit is created for each spill.

### Emulsion Wrapper

This program is used for data wrapper to give the scintillator detector information to
the emulsion detector analyzers.
This converts B2TrackSummary, B2BeamSummary, and so on into one simple class and enables them
to be analyzed by any other NINJA people.
